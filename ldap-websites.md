LDAP for CiviCRM.org websites
=============================

We expose the civicrm.org database as an LDAP server using LdapJS.
This is made possible using the following bits:

* CiviCRM extension: https://github.com/mlutfy/org.civicrm.ldapauthapi
* CiviLDAP forked from: https://github.com/TechToThePeople/ldapcivi (patch: https://gist.github.com/mlutfy/17622c2764472fbf71d0)
