# Continuous integration

Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of automating build, testing, and release during development.  [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/) is a
job-management system focused on CI â€“ and provides a large library of plugins for source-code management, quality-assurance, etc.

## Deployment architecture

* https://test.civicrm.org is the Jenkins "master" node.  It runs contiuously, providing the web UI for managing and browsing jobs.
* https://test.civicrm.org/duderino/ is a customized interface for initiating and tracking large matrix jobs.
* All the real work is done by sending jobs to "worker" nodes. Worker-nodes deal with different workloads and run on different classes of hardware.

| Node  | Workload | Machine Class |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `test-1` | Operates PR demo sites. Each site tends to live for a few days. | Public server, dedicated hardware (proper data center) |
| `test-2` | Build final releases and handles other glue. (It should not execute new/unapproved/unreviewed code.) | Public server, dedicated virtual machine (proper data center) |
| `test-3` | Execute test suites (PRs and scheduled). Based on `civicrm-buildkit:nix/bin/install-runner.sh`. | Public server, dedicated hardware (proper data center) |
| `test-4` | Execute test suites (PRs and scheduled). Based on `civicrm-buildkit:nix/bin/install-runner.sh`. | Firewalled desktop |
| `test-5` | Execute test suites (PRs and scheduled). Based on `civicrm-buildkit:nix/bin/install-runner.sh`. | Firewalled desktop |
| `bknix-run-XXXX` | Execute test suites (PRs and scheduled). Based on `civicrm-buildkit:nix/bin/install-runner.sh`. | Public cloud, spot VM |

* As you might expect, most nodes are dedicated toward running test-suites. (The test-suites are large.) It is interesting to compare a few nodes here:
    * `test-{3,4,5}` represent the *base capacity*. They are always available. In allocating machines, the key priorities are fast CPU cores
      and low monthly costs.
          * In recent years, firewalled desktops have provided best price/performance.  However, in principle, they compromise on availability (e.g. 
            using a single Internet uplink; using a small UPS; no 24x7 staffing).  There is a bit of risk to putting all capacity into firewalled
            desktops.
          * `test-3` is the safest part of the base-capacity. Even if `test-{4,5}` go down, we should be able to keep `test-3` going.
    * With `bknix-run-XXXX`, we can use Google Cloud to scale-up/scale-down under periods of high usage.
        * Pricing for "spot VMs" (cheaper, short-term nodes) is not great, but it's not terrible either.
        * However, these spot VMs can be killed at random times, and the current Jenkins setup doesn't cope well with the random interruptions. When it happens,
          it creates confusion/annoyance for developers reviewing test-results.
        * Spot VMs can be useful for (a) dealing with spikes in demand and (b) dealing with outages/maintenance in the base-capacity.

## Suggestions

* If we have ample base-capacity and don't need ephemeral nodes:
    * Go to https://test.civicrm.org/configureClouds/. Update the cloud configuration.
    * Drop the instance-limit to 1.
    * Find the general options for `bknix-run`. Set the node "Labels". Ensure they are "disabled" (i.e. `disabled-bknix-tmp disabled-bknix-tmp-edge`). This will prevent Jenkins from spawning more nodes.
* If the base-capacity isn't sufficient (*spikes in demand or maintenance/outages*) and we need more ephemeral nodes:
    * Go to https://test.civicrm.org/configureClouds/. Update the cloud configuration.
    * Check the instance-limit. Consider raising it to 2-4 nodes. (Note that each node can handle a couple parallel tests.)
    * Find the general options for `bknix-run`. Set the node "Labels". Ensure thare NOT "disabled" (i.e. `bknix-tmp bknix-tmp-edge`).
* If `test-4` or `test-5` become non-responsive:
    * Find an Android or iOS device.
    * Install and open the "Tapo" app from "TP-Link".
    * Login with a "TP-Link ID". (Note: the first time you use this, you'll need to create an account. Then go on Mattermost and ask for an invitation to see the devices.)
    * In the "Test Servers: Office", there should be nodes for `test-4` and `test-5` with options to power-off, power-on, and measure power-usage.
* If `test-4` becomes non-responsive:
    * (*It's possible to connect to a VPN and use Mesh Commander to open a console. Cost-benefit of documenting this isn't great -- need multiple credentials+tools, but only get access to one node, and it's very rare to need it. If in doubt, it's probably easier to re-enable gcloud nodes until someone gets physical hands on it.*)
