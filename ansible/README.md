Ansible playbooks for the CiviCRM internal infrastructure. These playbooks
are not for deploying CiviCRM itself, they are for managing the servers that
run the civicrm.org website, the issue tracker, the wiki and the test servers.

This is very much work in progress. Most of the servers are still managed by
Puppet.

### Getting started

Installing Ansible:

   sudo apt-get install ansible
